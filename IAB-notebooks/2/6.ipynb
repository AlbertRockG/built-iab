    "Machine learning algorithms are commonly used in bioinformatics for a variety of tasks. Typically, the common thread in these tasks is that the user would like the algorithm to assist in the identification of patterns in a complex data set. In this chapter we'll implement a few machine learning algorithms so we can gain an in-depth understanding of how they work. In practice though, there are many mature machine learning libraries that you'd want to use. [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) is a popular and well-documented Python library for machine learning which many bioinformatics researchers and software developers use in their work."

    "These algorithms generally work beginning with a collection of samples and some user-defined features of those samples. These data are typically represented in a matrix, where samples are the rows and features are the columns. There are a few different high-level tasks that are common in machine learning, including classification, regression, and dimensionality reduction. In a classification task, a user provides examples of data that fall into certain discrete classes (for example, _healthy_ and _disease_), and tries to have the computer develop a model that can differentiate those classes based on the defined features. If successful, the resulting model could be applied to data where the class isn't known ahead of time, in attempt to predict the class from the features. A regression task is similar, except that a continuous value will be predicted rather than a discrete value. Dimensionality reduction tasks, on the other hand, generally don't have classes or labels assigned ahead of time, and the user is hoping to identify which samples are most similar to each other based on new features that are defined by the algorithm. The goal here might be to reduce the number of features from thousands or more to around two or three that explain most of the variation in the data. This allows the user to explore the samples visually, for example in a scatter plot, which would not be feasible if there were thousands of features."

We'll then run our query sequences through those models to identify the most likely taxonomic origin of each query sequence. Since we know the taxonomic origin of our query sequences in this case, we can evaluate the accuracy of our classifiers by seeing how often they return the known taxonomy assignment. If our training and testing approaches are well-designed, the performance on our tests will inform us of how accurate we can expect our classifier to be on data where the actual taxonomic origin is unknown."
